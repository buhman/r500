Field Name             Bits   Default   Description
DWORDS_PER_VTX         6:0    0x0       This field specifies the number of DWORDS per vertex
                                        to expect when VAP_VF_CNTL.PRIM_WALK is set to
                                        Vertex Data (vertex data embedded in command stream).
                                        This field is not used for any other PRIM_WALK
                                        settings. This field replaces the usage of the
                                        VAP_VTX_FMT_0/1 for this purpose in prior
                                        implementations.
