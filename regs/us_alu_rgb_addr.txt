Field Name       Bits   Default Description
ADDR0            7:0    0x0     Specifies the identity of source operands rgb0, rgb1, and
                                rgb2. If the const field is set, this number ranges from 0
                                to 255 and specifies a location within the constant
                                register bank. Otherwise: If the most significant bit is
                                cleared, this field specifies a location within the current
                                pixel stack frame (ranging from 0 to 127). If the most
                                significant bit is set, then the lower 7 bits specify an
                                inline unsigned floating-point constant with 4 bit
                                exponent (bias 7) and 3 bit mantissa, including
                                denormals but excluding infinite/NaN.
ADDR0_CONST      8      0x0     Specifies whether the associated address is a constant
                                register address or a temporary address / inline constant.
                                POSSIBLE VALUES:
                                00 - TEMPORARY: Address temporary register or inline constant value.
                                01 - CONSTANT: Address constant register.
ADDR0_REL        9      0x0     Specifies whether the loop register is added to the value
                                of the associated address before it is used. This
                                implements relative addressing.
                                POSSIBLE VALUES:
                                00 - NONE: Do not modify source address.
                                01 - RELATIVE: Add aL before lookup.
ADDR1            17:10  0x0     Specifies the identity of source operands rgb0, rgb1, and
                                rgb2. If the const field is set, this number ranges from 0
                                to 255 and specifies a location within the constant
                                register bank. Otherwise: If the most significant bit is
                                cleared, this field specifies a location within the current
                                pixel stack frame (ranging from 0 to 127). If the most
                                significant bit is set, then the lower 7 bits specify an
                                inline unsigned floating-point constant with 4 bit
                                exponent (bias 7) and 3 bit mantissa, including
                                denormals but excluding infinite/NaN.
ADDR1_CONST      18     0x0     Specifies whether the associated address is a constant
                                register address or a temporary address / inline constant.

ADDR1_REL        19     0x0     Specifies whether the loop register is added to the value
                                of the associated address before it is used. This
                                implements relative addressing.
