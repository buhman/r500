Field Name       Bits   Default Description
TEX_ID           19:16  0x0     Specifies the id of the texture map used for this instruction
INST             24:22  0x0     Specifies the operation taking place for this instruction
                                POSSIBLE VALUES:
                                00 - NOP: Do nothing
                                01 - LD: Do Texture Lookup (S,T,R)
                                02 - TEXKILL: Kill pixel if any component is < 0
                                03 - PROJ: Do projected texture lookup (S/Q,T/Q,R/Q)
                                04 - LODBIAS: Do texture lookup with lod bias
                                05 - LOD: Do texture lookup with explicit lod
                                06 - DXDY: Do texture lookup with lod calculated from DX and DY
TEX_SEM_ACQUIRE  25     0x0     Whether to hold the texture semaphore until the data is
                                written to the temporary register.
                                POSSIBLE VALUES:
                                00 - Don`t hold the texture semaphore
                                01 - Hold the texture semaphore until the data is written to the temporary register.
IGNORE_UNCOVERED 26     0x0     If set, US will not request data for pixels which are
                                uncovered. Clear this bit for indirect texture lookups.
                                POSSIBLE VALUES:
                                00 - Fetch texels for uncovered pixels
                                01 - Don`t fetch texels for uncovered pixels
UNSCALED         27     0x0     Whether to scale texture coordinates when sending them
                                to the texture unit.
                                POSSIBLE VALUES:
                                00 - Scale the S, T, R texture coordinates from [0.0,1.0] to the dimensions of the target texture
                                01 - Use the unscaled S, T, R texture coordates.
