Field Name                  Bits   Default Description
PVS_FC_LOOP_INIT_VAL_0      7:0    0x0     This field stores the automatic loop index register init
                                           value. This is an 8-bit unsigned value 0-255. This field
                                           is only used if the corresponding control flow
                                           instruction is a loop.
PVS_FC_LOOP_STEP_VAL_0      15:8   0x0     This field stores the automatic loop index register step
                                           value. This is an 8-bit 2`s comp signed value -128-127.
                                           This field is only used if the corresponding control
                                           flow instruction is a loop.
PVS_FC_LOOP_REPEAT_NO_FLI_0 31     0x0     When this field is set, the automatic loop index register
                                           init value is not used at loop activation. The intial loop
                                           index is inherited from outer loop. The loop index
                                           register step value is used at the end of each loop
                                           iteration ; after loop completion, the outer loop index
                                           register is restored
