Field Name             Bits   Default   Description
VTX_NUM_ARRAYS         4:0    0x0       The number of arrays required to represent the current
                                        vertex type.
                                        Each Array is described by the following three fields:
                                        VTX_AOS_ADDR, VTX_AOS_COUNT,
                                        VTX_AOS_STRIDE.
VC_FORCE_PREFETCH      5      0x0       Force Vertex Data Pre-fetching. If this bit is set, then a
                                        256-bit word will always be fetched, regardless of which
                                        dwords are needed. Typically useful when
                                        VAP_VF_CNTL.PRIM_WALK is set to Vertex List
                                        (Auto-incremented indices).
VC_DIS_CACHE_INVLD     6      0x0       If set, the vertex cache is not invalidated between draw
                                        packets. This allows vertex cache hits to occur from
                                        packet to packet. This must be set with caution with
                                        respect to multiple contexts in the driver.
AOS_0_FETCH_SIZE       16     0x0       Granule Size to Fetch for AOS 0.
                                        0 = 128-bit granule size
                                        1 = 256-bit granule size
                                        This allows the driver to program the fetch size based on
                                        DWORDS/VTX/AOS combined with AGP vs. LOC
                                        Memory. The general belief is that the granule size
                                        should always be 256-bits for LOC memory and AGP8X
                                        data, but should be 128-bit for AGP2X/4X data if the
                                        DWORDS/VTX/AOS is less than TBD (128?) bits.
