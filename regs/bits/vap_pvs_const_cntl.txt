Field Name             Bits   Default Description
PVS_CONST_BASE_OFFSET  7:0    0x0     Vector Offset into PVS constant memory to the start of
                                      the constants for the current shader
PVS_MAX_CONST_ADDR     23:16  0x0     The maximum constant address which should be
                                      generated by the shader (Inst Const Addr + Addr
                                      Register). If the address which is generated by the shader
                                      is outside the range of 0 to PVS_MAX_CONST_ADDR,
                                      then (0,0,0,0) is returned as the source operand data.
