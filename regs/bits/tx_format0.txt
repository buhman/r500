Field Name             Bits   Default Description
TXWIDTH                10:0   none    Image width - 1. The largest image is 4096 texels. When
                                      wrapping or mirroring, must be a power of 2. When
                                      mipmapping, must be a power of 2 or padded to a power
                                      of 2 in memory. Can always be non-square, except for
                                      cube maps which must be square.
TXHEIGHT               21:11  none    Image height - 1. The largest image is 4096 texels. When
                                      wrapping or mirroring, must be a power of 2. When
                                      mipmapping, must be a power of 2 or padded to a power
                                      of 2 in memory. Can always be non-square, except for
                                      cube maps which must be square.
TXDEPTH                25:22  none    LOG2(depth) of volume texture
NUM_LEVELS             29:26  none    Number of mipmap levels minus 1. Ranges from 0 to 12.
                                      Equivalent to LOD index of smallest (coarsest) mipmap
                                      to use.
PROJECTED              30     none    Specifies whether texture coords are projected.
                                      POSSIBLE VALUES:
                                      00 - Non-Projected
                                      01 - Projected
TXPITCH_EN             31     none    Indicates when TXPITCH should be used instead of
                                      TXWIDTH for image addressing
                                      POSSIBLE VALUES:
                                      00 - Use TXWIDTH for image addressing
                                      01 - Use TXPITCH for image addressing
