Field Name            Bits   Default Description
ME_STAT               15:0   none    Status of MicroEngine internal registers. This value
                                     depends on the current value of the ME_STATMUX
                                     field. Read Only.
ME_STATMUX            20:16  0x0     Selects which status is to be returned on the ME_STAT
                                     field.
ME_BUSY               29     none    Busy indicator for the MicroEngine. Read Only.
                                     POSSIBLE VALUES:
                                     00 - MicroEngine not busy.
                                     01 - MicroEngine is active.
ME_MODE               30     0x1     Run-Mode of MicroEngine.
                                     POSSIBLE VALUES:
                                     00 - Single-Step Mode.

ME_STEP               31     0x0     Step the MicroEngine by one instruction. Writing a `1` to
                                     this field causes the MicroEngine to step by one
                                     instruction, if and only if the ME_MODE bit is a `0`.
