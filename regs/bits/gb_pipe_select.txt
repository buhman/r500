Field Name             Bits   Default Description
PIPE0_ID               1:0    0x0     Maps physical pipe 0 to logical pipe ID (def 0).
PIPE1_ID               3:2    0x1     Maps physical pipe 1 to logical pipe ID (def 1).
PIPE2_ID               5:4    0x2     Maps physical pipe 2 to logical pipe ID (def 2).
PIPE3_ID               7:6    0x3     Maps physical pipe 3 to logical pipe ID (def 3).
PIPE_MASK              11:8   0x0     4b mask, indicates which physical pipes are enabled (def
                                      none=0x0) -- B3=P3, B2=P2, B1=P1, B0=P0. -- 1:
                                      enabled, 0: disabled
MAX_PIPE               13:12  0x3     2b, indicates, by the fuses, the max number of allowed
                                      pipes. 0 = 1 pipe ... 3 = 4 pipes -- Read Only
BAD_PIPES              17:14  0xF     4b, indicates, by the fuses, the bad pipes: B3=P3, B2=P2,
                                      B1=P1, B0=P0 -- 1: bad, 0: good -- Read Only
CONFIG_PIPES           18     0x0     If this bit is set when writing this register, the logical
                                      pipe ID values are assigned automatically based on the
                                      values that are read back in the MAX_PIPE and
                                      BAD_PIPES fields. This field is always read back as 0.
                                      POSSIBLE VALUES:
                                      00 - Do nothing
                                      01 - Force self-configuration
