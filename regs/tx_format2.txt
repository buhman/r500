Field Name             Bits   Default Description
TXPITCH                13:0   none    Used instead of TXWIDTH for image addressing when
                                      TXPITCH_EN is asserted. Pitch is given as number of
                                      texels minus one. Maximum pitch is 16K texels.
TXFORMAT_MSB           14     none    Specifies the MSB of the texture format to extend the
                                      number of formats to 64.
TXWIDTH_11             15     none    Specifies bit 11 of TXWIDTH to extend the largest
                                      image to 4096 texels.
TXHEIGHT_11            16     none    Specifies bit 11 of TXHEIGHT to extend the largest
                                      image to 4096 texels.
POW2FIX2FLT            17     none    Optionally divide by 256 instead of 255 during fix2float.
                                      Can only be asserted for 8-bit components.
                                      POSSIBLE VALUES:
                                      00 - Divide by pow2-1 for fix2float (default)
                                      01 - Divide by pow2 for fix2float
SEL_FILTER4            19:18  none    If filter4 is enabled, specifies which texture component
                                      to apply filter4 to.
                                      POSSIBLE VALUES:
                                      00 - Select Texture Component0.
                                      01 - Select Texture Component1.
                                      02 - Select Texture Component2.
                                      03 - Select Texture Component3.
