DATA_REGISTER          31:0   0x0     This register is used to force a flush of the PVS block
                                      when single-buffered updates are performed. The multi-
                                      state control of PVS Code and Const memories by the
                                      driver is primarily for more flexible PVS state control
                                      and for performance testing. When this register address
                                      is written, the State Block will force a flush of PVS
                                      processing so that both versions of PVS state are
                                      available before updates are processed. This register is
                                      write only, and the data that is written is unused.
