Field Name                  Bits   Default Description
PVS_FC_ACT_ADRS_0           7:0    0x0     This field defines the last PVS instruction to execute
                                           prior to the control flow redirection.
                                           JUMP - The last instruction executed prior to the jump
                                           LOOP - The last instruction executed prior to the loop
                                           (init loop counter/inc)
                                           JSR - The last instruction executed prior to the jump to
                                           the subroutine.
PVS_FC_LOOP_CNT_JMP_INST_0  15:8   0x0     This field has multiple definitions as follows:
                                           JUMP - The instruction address to jump to.
                                           LOOP - The loop count. *Note loop count of 0 must be
                                           replaced by a jump.
                                           JSR - The instruction address to jump to (first inst of
                                           subroutine).
PVS_FC_LAST_INST_0          23:16  0x0     This field has multiple definitions as follows:
                                           JUMP - Not Applicable
                                           LOOP - The last instruction of the loop.
                                           JSR - The last instruction of the subroutine.
PVS_FC_RTN_INST_0           31:24  0x0     This field has multiple definitions as follows:
                                           JUMP - Not Applicable
                                           LOOP - First Instruction of Loop (Typically
                                           ACT_ADRS + 1)
                                           JSR - First Instruction After JSR (Typically
                                           ACT_ADRS + 1)
